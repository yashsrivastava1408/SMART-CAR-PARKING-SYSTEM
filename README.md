# SMART-CAR-PARKING-SYSTEM



IoT-Based Smart Energy Monitoring System is a real-time power monitoring solution that leverages IoT technology to track and visualize electricity consumption. Built using an Arduino microcontroller, current and voltage sensors, and Wi-Fi connectivity, the system collects and transmits live energy data to a cloud platform like Firebase or ThingSpeak.

Users can access detailed power usage insights through a simple and intuitive web interface, enabling them to:

ðŸ§  Understand usage patterns
ðŸ’¡ Detect energy wastage
ðŸ“‰ Optimize electricity consumption
ðŸ’° Estimate costs and reduce bills
This project is ideal for smart homes, institutions, and small industries aiming to improve energy efficiency and promote sustainable living.
